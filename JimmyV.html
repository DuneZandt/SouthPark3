    <br>Jimmy valmer is a well-liked guy in South Park. He gets along with everyone and is easy to agree with. After a small period of time where he and Timmy hated each other, they became best friends, attending disabled events together like camp and The Special Olympics. He loves comedy and performing on stage, this is why it's no suprise that he becomes a comedian in Post-Covid. He also likes to report news and write newspapers for the school, letting nothing tarnish or censor the honesty of it. He's also shown to be a smart kid, able to do scientific testing on water bears with Timmy as his partner. He occasionally has his mishaps, but they aren't often and he usually apologizes and comes around afterwards.</p>
