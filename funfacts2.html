    <h3>Some Random Fun Facts</h3>

    <br>


<p class="warn">-When their episode “Terrance and Phillip in Not Without my @nus” aired, the reaction from viewers was bad. This episode was aired after Matt and Trey purposely created a cliffhanger with figuring out who Cartman’s dad was, and instead played Terrance and Phillip because they thought it was funny. Viewers did not. They sent them hundreds of angry emails, forcing Matt and Trey to make the sequel immediately after Terrance and Phillip (they were planning to prolong it.)</p>
<br>
<p class="warn">    -Matt and Trey used to take photos farting on celebrities because they found it funny.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">   -Cartman Gets an @nal Probe is the only South Park Episode made completely out of construction paper.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">   -As the episodes progress in season one, you can visibly see as they got more used to the animation software based on how the textures look on the characters.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">   -The South Park Movie includes 399 curse words and profanities; the reason it isn’t 400 is because just one more would land their movie in the NC-17 rating strictly for adults, and they wanted it to be an R rated movie. </p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">   -For the character Chef, they immediately knew who they wanted to voice him. Their first choice was Isaac Hayes, not really expecting anything to come out of it, but then they were informed that Isaac Hayes would do it and that he was excited. This was actually a lie; Isaac Hayes had agreed, but he had no idea what it was for, just that it was an adult show.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -A few celebrities attempted to try and get roles in the show since it was getting popular, but Matt and Trey would always offer them the roles of animals that could only make animal noises, which they found funny. They did actually get George Clooney for Stan’s dog and Jay Leno for Cartman’s cat.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -In the original version of the pilot, Cartman can be seen eating dinner with his family. However, you can also see that a father and sister was sitting at the table too, characters that wouldn’t ever come to exist.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Matt and Trey actually don’t like the early seasons of South Park; they’re embarrassed of it and think that it doesn’t accurately represent how South Park is today. This would be accurate since the first three seasons was just them figuring out everything, and after that, the characters and stories would be more clear.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Matt and Trey have trouble writing plots and stories for the South Park episodes because they often get informed that the Simpsons had already done something similar. This inspired the S6E7 South Park Episode “Simpsons Already Did It.”</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Trey Parker has his daughter voice the young pre-school kids and toddlers.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Kenny McCormick is based on a kid that Trey Parker knew in real life. The character and his real life counterpart both shared the same name, orange parka, and had a spotty attendance. Because of the real life Kenny’s spotty appearances, the other kids would joke that he died, just for him to come back a few days later.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -When the show was first being created, Comedy Central hated the character “Mr. Hankey.” They kept asking and advising Matt and Trey to remove the character, because a talking piece of Christmas poop was stupid and bizarre. Matt and Trey fought for Mr. Hankey.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -For a while, celebrities that Parker and Stone chose to be on South Park, no matter how obscure, would end up either dying, getting in a scandal, or getting more famous. People started calling this the “South Park Curse.”</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Matt and Trey voice almost all the characters, even some female ones.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Every since the first South Park Episode, the creators have been hiding secret Visitors throughout their episodes. Sometimes they’re easier to find, sometimes they’re harder. They usually blend in with the characters and backgrounds, so they unusually go unfound by the average viewer.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Matt and Trey still write all of the scripts, voice the characters, and stay largely in control of the show and their stories. This is an uncommon factor with adult cartoons, with others usually hiring someone else to do it instead.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Butters is based on Eric Stough, the animation director for South Park. Matt and Trey nicknamed Eric “little buddy.”</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -South Park has had a total of 6 banned episodes, which are all banned for their depiction of Muhammad. Despite how hard Matt and Trey fought for it, Comedy Central was scared into not airing the episodes.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -The men in Stan’s family pass down the addiction gene. This is clearly shown in the episode “Freemium Isn’t Free,” which shows his grandpa being to gambling, his dad being addicted to drinking, and Stan being addicted to a stupid mobile game that he keeps buying stuff for. This is why it makes sense of Stan’s character to get addicted to alcohol in Post-Covid.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Towelie was originally only made to poke fun at things that are purely made just to make merchandise off of. This is why Towelie is a 2-dimensional character with little personality.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">   -The iconic phrase of “Oh my god, they killed Kenny!” “You b@stards!” Is actually Stan and Kyle nodding to the creators of the show. “They” is referring to Matt and Trey, which is why it makes much sense to say “they” even when Kenny was killed by one person or not a person at all.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Cartman is based on Archie Bunker. The creators thought it’d be funny to create a character like Archie, and they thought that they could get away with it by making the character a kid. They were totally right.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -It takes the South Park Team only six days to make an episode, which includes all of the planning, scriptwriting, voices, and animating. The crew often spends overtime making the episode. The reason they take such a short time making episodes is to A. Keep up with the relevance of current events and B. Because Trey is a perfectionist who could spend months on one episode if he could, and he claims that this would barely make the episode better, so it’s better to just get it over with and make it the best you can in that period of time.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -When the South Park Movie came out, Brian Boitano heard that he was mentioned in the film, causing him to be nervous about seeing the movie since he thought he was going to be made fun of. But to his delight, he was practically a legend to the boys, and he’d often use the quote “What Would Brian Boitano Do?” For various things.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -There was only one time when South Park missed a deadline for an episode, and that was because of a blackout.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -In the episode “Kenny Dies,” Kenny was supposed to be killed off permanently. However, this received backlash because people liked Kenny so much, so he comes back in the last episode of the next season. </p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Regarding the previous fact, Kyle was the character who was actually supposed to die. The creators felt like he was too similar to Stan and so should be removed. However, they later decided against this, making each of their different traits more prominent. Trey also mentions in an interview that it’s common for best friends to try and be like each other, so it also adds some realism to the show.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Comedy Central refused to air the episode “It Hits the Fan” for the amount of times the episode says the sh word, but Matt and Trey eventually convinced them not to because when a word is said so much, it loses it's meaning.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Butters was originally going to be named Poof Poof.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -When “Trapped in the Closet,” a South Park Episode poking fun at Scientology, came out, the church of Scientology paid for an investigation on Matt and Trey to find incriminating facts. They found nothing.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -The Simpsons loved the Cartoon Wars South Park episodes making fun of Family Guy. They actually loved it so much that they sent flowers.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Every single South Park episode, special/movie, and game has either featured a celebrity or mentioned one.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Stan Marsh is based off of Trey Parker and Kyle Broflovski is based off of Matt Stone. Both boy’s parents share the same name as the creator’s parents, and Ike is the only family member between these two that doesn’t exist in real life.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -It’s usually impossible to tell what Kenny is saying due to his hood, but all of his lines are actually scripted. He never says gibberish.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Trey Parker’s favorite character is Cartman. He and Matt state in an interview that there’s a little Cartman in all of us.</p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -Primus made South Park’s theme song.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -In every Halloween special, someone dresses as Chewbacca.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Cartman’s mom is named after Trey’s ex-girlfriend who cheated on him, and in an interview, he also mentions that Cartman’s mom is like his own mom in a way. Not the sleeping around part, the being really sweet and baking goods part. </p>
<br>   
<p class="warn">  -The Tourette Syndrome association praised South Park for it's accurate and well-researched information on Tourette’s Syndrome in the episode “Le Petite Tourette”.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Mr. Mackey is based on a real counselor that Trey had back in school. His name was Mr. Lackey and kids used to mock the way he spoke, much how the kids do in South Park.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Trey Parker plays with legos when he needs inspiration.</p>
<br>    
<p class="warn">  -Mary Kay Bergman was the voice actor behind a majority of the female voices until she died in 1999.</p>
