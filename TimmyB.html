    <br>Timmy Burch first came on the show as a joke and was meant to be a one time character. However, people loved him so much that he stayed. At first, the whole joke was that all he could say was his name, but over the years, he's gained some personality. He can't speak properly or use his legs, but his thinking isn't affected much. The kids all treat him like a normal guy which in incredibly cool to see. He's pretty caring, trying to help Jimmy when finding out he shoots up, and in a different episode, taking a bullet for his pet turkey. He's also smart too; he worked with Jimmy on a science project and in TFBW, is able to use his psychic abilities to communicate. The show has definitely gotten better with developing him over the years. Also, sometimes he gets sassy, which I think is really funny. Not much of the characters are sassy.</p>
