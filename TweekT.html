    <br>Tweek cannot stop twitching. He's constantly moving some part of his body, and there are multiple reasons- he downs twenty cups of coffee per day, anxiety, and the fact that his parents lace his coffee. His parents also claim that he has ADD, but this is most likely an excuse. They make their son work at their coffee shop and can't see how bad it's affecting him. They aren't good parents, they force their son into stressful situations, only like that he's gay because it promotes their business, and even threatened to sell Tweek once. Tweek sees a therapist to try and control himself and to calm down, but usually outside disturbances bring him out of the zen. Fidget toys don't make him calmer and nobody really listens to him. However, it gets somewhat better when he starts dating Craig. Craig attempts to listen and communicate and allows Tweek to rant, which helps him a bunch and causes him to be calmer later in the show.</p>
