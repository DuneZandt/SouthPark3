    <br>Clyde Donovan's personality is a mix of Stan's and Cartman's. Like Stan, he prioritizes his self-image and will do what he can to maintain it. He doesn't like standing out or being considered a loser, but when he does get popular, he gets cocky about it. Like Cartman, he can act out on things (as seen in "Not Suitable for Children" when he yells at his step-mom) and has even defended him before. He's also really sensitive and has cried multiple times throughout the show when things get stressful. He ends up using ChatGPT to respond to his girlfriend's messages because he thinks she's annoying. Like the other boys, he's a jerk, but he has been really funny at times.</p>
