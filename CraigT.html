    <br>Craig Tucker in a monotone and pragmatic kid. He's honest, blunt, and thought of as rude. He likes to use sarcasm and passive aggressive behavior towards people who he doesn't like, as demonstrated in the Pandemic episodes. He's a trouble maker too; he gets bad grades, ends up in the counselor's office a ton, and also lands in detention frequently. He's rarely ever seen happy beacuse he's usually either neutral, frustrated, or mad. He also has a bad habit of flipping everyone off. However, he does have some things he takes interest in; in "Tweek vs Craig", he expresses having a love for a racing show called "Red Racer", stating that he watches it every day of the week and won't do anything else when it's on. He also likes guinea pigs and ends up owning multiple throughout the show, all named "Stripe." He gets mad when people insult his guinea pig since he holds such a passion for them. He also dates Tweek later on in the show, which has helped his character go through development and be more considerate for other people.</p>
