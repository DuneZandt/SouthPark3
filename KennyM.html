    <br>A lot of South Park fans like Kenny. Kenny and Butters are both fan favorites, and it's easy to see why. Kenny can never be understood through his hood and he dies constantly, each death being more unique than the last. He says bizarre and unfiltered things all of the time and is a really funny character. He also cares about his friends and family, his biggest priority being his siblings, especially Karen. He doesn't like his immortality and views it as a curse, and he often copes with his life in unhealthy ways- but later on, he learns to use his curse through his superhero persona, Mysterion. He has made a ton of self-sacrifices for others and it's clear he's a really nice and caring guy- when he isn't sniffing paint and throwing rocks at cars.</p>
