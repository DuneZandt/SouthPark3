    <br>Stan Marsh is sometimes seen as the main character out of the four. This is because he started off as an everyman character, someone the visitors could see themselves in. He was based off of Trey Parker, sharing some attributes with him like having blue eyes, loving animals, and loving tabletop games + fantasy. He stands with Kyle as the voice of reason, but he can become unreasonable. He prioritizes his own self-image over family and friends, which has gotten him into trouble at times. As the show progresses, he becomes more cynical and depressed, and goes on to be a depressed alcoholic in Post-Covid.</p>
