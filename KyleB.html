    <br>Kyle Broflovski is the smartest out of the four. He's described to have good grades and his intelligence definitely shows through when considering his behaviour. He's a genuinely caring guy who tries to better himself and keep good morals. However, his two faults are his anger issues and his need to be in the right. Being around Cartman genuinely brings out the worst in him, which is fun to see, but makes him less pleasant to be around. His need to be in the right also clouds his judgement, causing him to act like a know-it-all and even to try and justify his actions, even if they aren't good. He's a very opinionated guy and isn't afraid to speak his mind. However, his morals cause him to feel guilt when he's an adult- and a longing to be friends with the other three again.</p>
