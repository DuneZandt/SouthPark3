    <h3>References in the Show</h3>

    <h2 class="extreme">*I didn't have enough time to do every season, so there's only season one here so far (which took horrendously long.) I will be active with adding information to this website though :)</h2>

    <h2>Season 1</h2>

    <h4>Episode 1: Cartman Gets an *nal Probe</h4>

    <p class="warn">-During the intro, a fight between Jesus and Santa is seen on the billboard. This is a reference to The Spirit of Christmas (1995).</p>
<br>
    <p class="warn">-During the scene where Officer Barbrady is investigating a mutilated cow carcass, the farmer mentions seeing black CIA helicopters and trucks. It’s common for unmarked helicopters from the CIA to be a trademark in UFO or Alien Abduction stories, often including the government trying to cover it up.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="warn">-There are multiple sentences on the chalkboard during class. One of them mentions Kathie Lee Gifford. “I’m not positive, but I think Cathy Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be.”</p>
    <br>
     <p class="warn">-The train conductor refuses to let cows on his train because his train is a people train and not a cow train. This is a reference to an obscure Dr. Suess' book called “In a People House.” </p>
     <br>        
     <p class="warn"> -The milk cartons in the cafeteria read “Parker’s Milk,” which is indeed referring to Trey Parker. </p>
     <br>    
    <p class="warn">  -When Stan sees Wendy during lunch, his smile resembles Charlie Brown’s smile when he sees the red haired girl.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn"> -The music that plays during the cafeteria scene when Stan sees Wendy is from Romeo and Juliet by Pyotr Tchaikovsky. </p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">-There are moments where Cartman and Officer Barbrady get zapped under alien control for a few moments, causing them to dance around and sing “I Want to Singa” by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg. This is originally from a Tex Avery Merry Melodies short.</p>
    <br>        
 <p class="warn"> -The music that plays during the Matt and Trey skit “Fireside Chat With Matt and Trey” introductions plays when Cartman enters his house.</p>
 <br>      
     <p class="warn"> -Matt Stone’s sister is framed as a photo in Cartman’s house.</p>
     <br>      
    <p class="warn"> -While Cartman watches the news, the aliens are reported on. The reporter reports how crop circles form strange patterns, then shows a picture of the crop circles joining together to make a picture of Cartman. Cartman states that the picture kind of looks like Tom Selleck, completely oblivious to what it’s supposed to be. Tom Selleck is an actor known for playing Thomas Magnum in “Magnum P.I.”.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn"> -When Cartman farts fire, Wendy says that he’s just like Rudolph, a reference to Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn"> -When Chef is waiting for the visitors outside, he calls out for them to hurry up because there’s twenty minutes until “Sanford and Son” is on. A cool thing about this show is that the producer, Norman Lear, goes on to be a staff writer for South Park in the future.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn"> -Kyle tries to convince Ike to jump off of the alien spaceship and into the snow by telling him to do an impersonation of David Caruso’s career, which Ike responds by yelling “It’s my turn!” And jumping off the ship. David Caruso had ended a successful term on “NYPD BLUE”.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn"> -At the end, Cartman gets dropped off by the visitors and mentions how he dreamt that Scott Baio gave him pinkeye. (It wasn’t a dream. It actually happened.) Scott Baio was an actor who played Charles on “Charles in Charge.”</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">-Officer Barbrady’s voice is based on Dennis Prager. He had a radio show near the time and Matt and Trey liked to make fun of his “big, bombastic, stupid voice.”</p>
    
    <h4>Episode 2: Weight Gain 4000</h4>

    <p class="warn"> -Kathie Lee Gifford plays a huge role in this episode. She comes to visit South Park to present Cartman an award for writing the best environmental essay. At this time, she was popular for being the co-host on “Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.” </p>
    <br>
     <p class="warn">       -Cartman wins the environmental essay contest by stealing “Walden” by Henry David Thoreau, replacing Henry’s name with his own.</p>
     <br>       
     <p class="warn">       -One of the mayor’s aides makes a joke about Kathie Lee especially liking children if they worked in a sweatshop. This is because in 1996, the National Labor Committee had reported that a line of Kathie Lee clothing was distributed through sweatshop labor.</p>
     <br>       
    <p class="warn">   -At lunch, Cartman brags about how when he’s going to be on TV, he’ll be totally famous. Wendy overhears while walking by and remarks that H!tler was famous too.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">       -Chef claims that his “man part” is three times bigger than Frank Gifford’s. Frank Gifford is Kathie Gifford’s husband and was a football player for the New York Giants.</p>
    <br>      
     <p class="warn">   -At a talent show when Kathie Lee was a kid, she sings “If They Could See Me Now.” She sang the song in real life in Carnival Cruise Lines commercials.</p>
     <br>      
     <p class="warn">  -Weight Gain 4000 is supposed to be a parody of powders that make you bulk up muscle mass. These only really work if you exercise regularly, and they can also cause health problems. That’s why when the commercial ends, the announcer states really quickly that it might “cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver.”</p>
     <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Mr. Hat’s head spinning around and speaking demonically is a reference to The Exorcist.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -In the play Mr. Garrison does for the children, he mentions that South Park was originally Ute Indian land. The Ute Indians did actually exist in what is now Colorado and Utah.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Mr. Garrison speaking to himself in the mirror at Jimbo’s Guns is a reference to “Taxi Driver” by Robert De Niro. The same lines are said by Travis Bickle.</p>
    <br>      
     <p class="warn">  -Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat try to shoot Kathie Lee from the book depository, which parallels the JFK Assassination. Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK from the Texas School Book Depository.</p>
     <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -Chef claims that Kathie Lee is more special than Mary Tyler Moore. She was an actress who acted on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in the 70s. He also states that Kathie Lee is more special than a “Value Meal at Happy Burger,” most likely referencing Burger King value meals.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -When Wendy tries to convince Mr. Garrison not to take the shot, he replies with “It is… too late for me, young Wendy.” This is a quote Darth Vader says in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, when Luke tries to convince Darth Vader to leave the dark side.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -On the trophy Kathie Lee holds, Org*zmo is on top in gold. This is a reference to Matt and Trey’s Org*zmo.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">   -After Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat get caught, Mr. Hat says they could’ve gotten away with it if it weren’t for those meddling kids, a line often used in Scooby Doo when they capture a criminal.</p>
    <br>     
     <p class="warn">   -At the end of the episode, Cartman finally gets on TV, but just to show and educate people on obesity. (He doesn’t know that.) It’s shown on a Geraldo talk show, who at this time had his own show on NBC.</p>
     <br>     
     <p class="warn">  -Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat having different opinions and personalities is based off of other books and shows where the guy with the puppet often had multiple personalities and speaks to their puppets.</p>
    
     <h4>Episode 3: Volcano</h4>

     <p class="warn">-Cartman’s mom packed Happy Tarts for Cartman's lunch. Happy tarts were also mentioned in Orga*zmo.</p>
     <br>
    <p class="warn">   -Jimbo and Ned were soldiers in the Vietnam War. Cartman lies and says he also fought in ‘Nam, and Ned responds by asking if he was stationed in Da Nang, which was a major U.S. Air Force base.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn">   -Jimbo blames the strict hunting and conservation laws on Democrats, who were in power in 1997.</p>
    <br>      
     <p class="warn">    -When Cartman starts having his fake flashbags from Vietnam, he tells a guy named Danforth to “watch out for Charlies up in the trees.” Charlie is slang for the phrase “Victor Charlie,” a NATO phonetic alphabet name for the Viet Cong Army.</p>
     <br>     
     <p class="warn">    -Jimbo and Ned yell “It’s coming right for us!” before they hunt animals to avoid getting in trouble with the law. This references an incident in Colorado where a man shot three black bears, a protected species, and used a similar excuse; “They were coming right for us!”</p>
     <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Stan is unable to shoot any animals, and in response, Cartman tells him to go back to Woodstock. This is a reference to the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969. Most who went were Hippies.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn"> -When Ned accidentally lights himself on fire, Jimbo jokes that he should “stop, drop, and roll.” This is a common fire safety phrase that everyone has heard at least once in their life.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Mount Evanston is named after Mount Evans in Colorado.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -When the mayor gets informed about the evident eruption that would take place in South Park, she tells her aide to call Inside Edition (magazine series featuring crime, celebrity gossip, and human interest stories), Rescue 911 (television program featuring reenactments of 911 phone calls), and Entertainment Tonight (TV series on celebrity gossip).</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Cartman makes up a monster named Scuzzlebutt who has Patrick Duffy for a leg. The others don’t find it scary, and Cartman responds with “What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?” Step By Step was a sitcom starring Patrick Duffy.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -Jimbo and Ned perform the song “Kumbaya” while sitting around the campfire. This is a popular Christian folk song.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -Jimbo and Ned want to get on the cover of the “Guns & Ammo” magazine, a magazine for gun enthusiasts.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn"> -The townspeople are shown an old educational video to teach them how to avoid getting hurt by lava. It’s titled “Lava and You,” and is a parody of a real life safety video called “Duck and Cover.” Duck and Cover was made to educate people on nuclear explosion safety techniques and suggested that ducking and covering would protect from a nuclear bomb, which Lava and You says the same things will protect people from lava.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn"> -Matt and Trey came up with the idea for this episode after watching two films based on Volcano disasters- Dante’s Peak and Volcano (1997).</p>

    <h4>Episode 4: Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride</h4>

    <p class="warn">-The reason Big Gay Al seems like such a big, over the top gay guy is because he’s a tribute to Big Al on Laugh-In, a comedy sketch show.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="warn">    -Instead of writing about Asian culture like he was supposed to, Cartman writes and makes a speech on how the characters on Simon & Simon are not actually brothers in real life.</p>
    <br>     
     <p class="warn">    -Since Stan’s dog is gay, Fosse rips on him and asks if his dog has been to any pride marches lately. Pride Marches are common in the LGBTQ community.</p>
     <br>     
     <p class="warn">    -To rip on Stan’s dog for being gay, he suggests Sparky (the dog) go to a Barbara Streisand concert.</p>
     <br>     
     <p class="warn">   -At the halftime show for the South Park vs Middle Park football game, Rich Stamos, John Stamos’s older brother, was supposed to sing “Lovin’ You.” This song was originally sung by Minnie Riperton. However, in real life, John Stamos doesn’t have an older brother named Richard Stamos.</p>
     <br>     
    <p class="warn">   -Jimbo and Ned trying to trigger the bomb to explode with a simple high F was inspired by the exploding piano gag in various different Looney Toons episodes.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -Cartman’s mom told Cartman that god hates gay people and that’s why he “smote those sodomies in France.” He is confusing the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the bible.</p>
    <br>     
     <p class="warn">   -Stan wishes his dog was a “Rin-Tin-Tin” instead of gay.  Rin-Tin-Tin was a dog featured in many radio and television programs in the 20s and 30s.</p>
     <br>    
    <p class="warn">   -When Stan tells Chef that he’s upset because his dog is gay, Chef says that “you can’t teach a gay dog straight tricks.” This is a play on “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">   -During the football game, one of the sports announcers states that he “hasn’t seen a beating like that since Rodney King” after seeing a kid get tackled harshly. Rodney King was recorded being beaten by police officers, which eventually led to the 1992 LA Riots. When Pip is tackled sometime afterwards, the announcer says he hasn’t seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant was arrested in 1995 after being caught performing an inappropriate act in public with a pr*stitute.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">   -When Stan goes onto the Big Gay Boat Ride, he eventually gets to a section where many characters begin singing a song titled “We Are Gay.” This is a parody of It’s a Small World at Disneyland. Among the figures is Brian Boitano, the Olympic skater.</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -Big Gay Al’s disappearance into his suitcase references Dr. Lao’s disappearance at the end of “The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao.”</p>
    <br>     
    <p class="warn">  -In the credits, “Now You’re a Man” by DVDA (a band that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are in) plays. This song was also in Org*zmo.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn">  -Sparky (Stan’s dog) is voiced by George Clooney.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Another offensive joke made by the TV Announcers states that the South Park Cows were getting m*lested by the Cowboys, and that he hadn’t seen so much children m*lested since Michael Jackson came to town, but this was later cut in all reruns, video, and DVD versions of the episode.</p>

    <h4>Episode 5: An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig</h4>

    <p class="warn">-Shelly Marsh is based off of Trey Parker’s sister, who used to beat him up all the time and even threw him down the stairs one time.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="warn">     -At one point, Cartman tells Kyle to go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews. He likely has Jewish people mixed up with Hippies, which makes sense since he hates both groups. (This is the first time Cartman ever rips on Kyle for being Jewish.)</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn">      -Doctor Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando, an actor who played Dr. Moreau in The Island of Dr. Mareau (1996.) </p>
    <br>      
     <p class="warn">      -Dr. Mephesto and Chef both reference a song by Loverboy called “Pig and Elephant DNA Just Won’t Splice.” This is once again a reference to Matt and Trey’s band, DVDA. They recorded the song with Loverboy in real life.</p>
     <br>      
    <p class="warn">     -When Stan’s clone was being created, it sat in an incubator in Mephesto’s lab and resembled the fetus at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">     -When singing the song “Love Gravy” to get the pig and the elephant to make love, Chef’s vocals are backed up by Elton John. It references “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” in the Lion King, even taking on a similar name, “Tonight is Right for Love.”</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the evil Stan clone destroying the city, he responds by saying they've been watching too much of the X-Files.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -Pip is a character taken from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. He quotes the first paragraph of the book.</p>
    <br>      
     <p class="warn">     -The last line said in the episode by Eric Cartman was “That’ll do, pig.” It’s a reference to the movie Babe after Babe wins the contest.</p>

    <h4>Episode 6: Death</h4>

    <p class="warn">-Terrance and Phillip are based both on the show’s creators and the characters in Beavis & Butt-Head. </p>
    <br>
     <p class="warn">     -Kyle mentions a guy named “Jack Laborkian” who “goes around and murders people who ask him to, and he doesn’t get into any trouble at all.” He is referencing Jack Kevorkian who was involved in almost 100 assisted suicides in the 90s.</p>
     <br>       
    <p class="warn">    -The Cartoon Central TV network is a parody of both Cartoon Network and Comedy Central.</p>
    <br>      
     <p class="warn">    -Sheila Broflovski, Kyle’s mom, states that she wants more quality television like Full House.</p>
     <br>       
     <p class="warn">    -Stan’s grandpa forces Stan to listen to “Gonna Fly” by Toddy Walters, which is  a parody of Enya’s Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)”.</p>
     <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -Cartoon Central finally takes down Terrance and Phillip at the end of the episode, instead replacing it with “She’s the Sheriff” starring Suzanne Somers.</p>
    <br>     
     <p class="warn">  -When Stan’s grandpa tries to convince Stan to kill him, Stan responds by saying “I can’t even kill a deer”, a throwback to S1E3 Volcano.</p>
    

    <h4>Episode 7: Pinkeye</h4>

    <p class="warn">-While Cartman’s mom is decorating the house for Halloween, she sings about creepy, crawly things while hanging up a picture of former President Richard Nixon.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="warn">      -While Chef is watching the news in his house, a poster of Isaac Hayes, his voice actor, can be seen on the wall.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn">     -The space station that randomly crashes onto Kenny in the beginning is the space station Mir. This space station was developed by the Soviet Union and de-orbited in the year 2000. At the time this episode aired, the Mir space stations had had two accidents, but neither involved crashing into earth.</p>
    <br>       
    <p class="warn">    -When Kenny gets sent to the morgue, one of the attendants brings Worcestershire sauce and just starts putting it on all his food. </p>
    <br>

    <br>       
    <p class="warn">    -At the end of the episode, the DVDA song “I Am Chewbacca” plays in the credits.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">     -Stan and Wendy had originally planned to dress as Raggedy Ann and Andy before Wendy changed up the plan without letting him know.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">     -Cartman dresses up as Adolf Hitler for a Halloween costume.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">     -Since Cartman thinks Stan’s outfit is stupid, he calls him Howdy Doody and Holly Hobby. Howdy Doody was a marionette on a children’s show also called Howdy Doody from 1947-1960. Holly Hobby is a character created by someone also named Holly Hobby. Holly Hobby became famous when on American Greetings brand greeting cards.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -There are multiple references to pinkeye. The doctor thinks that all of these zombies are actually all just people with pinkeye.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -Mr. Garrison is dressed up as Marilyn Monroe.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -Cartman makes a mistake believing that Wookies, like Chewbacca, live on Endor. In reality, teddy bear looking Ewoks live on Endor. Wookies live on Kashyyyk. This mix up is a reference to the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978.) Chewbacca and his family are shown to be in a treehouse similar to the Ewoks. </p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -Mr. Garrison teaches the kids about Jackie Collins, a British novelist. He refers to her as a “horror writer,” but she was in fact not; she actually wrote s*xual romance novels. </p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -The whole zombie situation is actually based off of Return of the Living Dead. A series of scenes- for example, the scene where the doctors describe the zombies’ symptoms, are all throwbacks to the film.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -Chef is dressed up as Evel Knieveal, a motorcycle stuntman. Principal Victoria mistakes his outfit for Elvis Presley.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -When Principal Victoria finds out about Cartman’s offensive costume, she makes him a scary ghost costume out of a white sheet instead. However, she accidentally makes the costume look like KKK robes.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">    -In Principal Victoria’s office, she has a poster with “Puffy the Bear,” a parody of Smokey the Bear. He also appears in the educational video of Hitler that the principal shows to Cartman.</p>

    <br>

    <br>      
    <p class="warn">  -Cartman calls Stan Pippi Longstocking to make fun of his costume again. Pippi Longstocking is a character created by Astrid Lindgren.</p>

    <p class="warn">       -Wendy sends all the candy she won from the Halloween costume contest to hungry children in Nairobi, which ironically, is a well developed city.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">       -When Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are caught doing something inappropriate, they claim that it has nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia. This is a reference to the Yakuza, the original organized crime families in Japan.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">       -The fat man that hands out candy is wearing a shirt that says “Let’s Get Physical,” which is a reference to the song “Physical” by Steve Kipner and performed by Olivia Newton-John. </p>
    <br>

    <br>      
    <p class="warn">       -When Chef turns into a zombie, he starts dancing along to a song similar to Thriller like in the Michael Jackson music video. At the end, he pulls open his shirt and yells “OOOHHH!” Michael Jackson did this in the Black or White music video.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">       -According to the woman on the Worcestershire sauce hotline, you have to kill the original zombie to stop the apocalypse. This is more common with vampires instead of zombies in other media though.</p>
    <br>      
    <p class="warn">      -In the graveyard where Kenny is buried, one of the tombs has a statue of Org*zmo on it.</p>
