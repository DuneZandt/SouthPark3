    <br>Butters is definitely a goodie two shoes, and you can thank his parents for that. With their constant groundings over every little thing, Butters tries hard to be a good kid. Out of the cast, he's the one that acts the most like a fourth grader; he's innocent, playful, and just acts like an actual kid. It sucks that his tendency to be gullible and polite gets him taken advantage of. The main four are seen using Butters a lot, but Cartman definitely uses him the most. Butters has been able to recognize a pattern of kids bullying and using him, but he knows he can't do anything about it while he's his normal self. So instead, he gets revenge through his supervillain presona- Professor Chaos! Even if his evil plans don't seem that evil, he's tired of being the dorky kid.</p>
