    <br>Tolkien Black is probably the most normal kid in South Park Elementary. He's never been absurdly outrageous nor has he been that unreasonable. He pays attention in school, gets good grades, and hangs out with his friends. He has a good relationship with his parents and is a nice kid. In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he gets upset that his friends rip on him for being rich. He tries to dress more poor so that his friends will like him again, then once he realizes he won't fit in, gets more rich people to move into town. However, he doesn't fit in with the rich people either, so he tries to fit in with lions. He doesn't. He eventually goes back to his friends and finds out that they've always liked him, they just rip on all their friends. This episode shows that Tolkien is not unaffected by social pressures and probably prefers to play it safe. He's pretty calm compared to the other boys. However, in "Raisans", Tolkien ends up stealing Stan's girlfriend, Wendy. In another episode, Kyle stops hanging out with Stan to hang out with Tolkien to film Tiktoks. However, after Stan got over it, they ended up being friends. Especially considering Tolkien's family buys a farm across from Stan's. They like to play tabletop games together.</p>
