    <br>Wendy Testaburger is a very smart and political little girl. She's the class president and often stands up for others and inserts her opinion. She's another voice of reason and butts heads with Cartman. She tries her best to make the school a better place and helps as many people as she can. Wendy is Stan's on and off girlfriend and has been since the beginning of the show. However, she can occasionally get unreasonably jealous over him in stupid situations. She's also cheated on him before and is always the one to break it off. She depends on communication in a relationship, which is why her and Stan aren't a very good match. She also has pretty good physical strength. She beat Cartman in a fight after he kept making fun of Breast Cancer and trying to make her look stupid. In TFBW, her superhero persona is Call Girl. She specializes in social media and technology.</p>
