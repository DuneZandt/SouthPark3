        <h3>Trey Parker</h3>
        <div class="container">
        <p> Trey Parker was born on October 19, 1969 in Conifer, Colorado. His mother was an insurance saleswoman named Sharon, and his father was a geologist named Randolph “Randy” Parker II. He also had a sister named Shelley, who liked to beat him up. Does this sound familiar? Well, if you’re somewhat educated on the show and the character Stan Marsh, then you’d realize that this information mirrors him. This is because when Stan Marsh was created, he was meant to be based off of Trey as a kid. Of course, this has changed somewhat over the years, which I will discuss on the character page of this website. The character’s dad is directly based off of Trey’s, even down to his occupation. This is the same with Shelley Marsh, Stan’s sister. Stan’s mom is a little different, since Trey’s mom was described as “more like Cartman’s mom, but without the pr*stitution.” Sharon (the character) works as a receptionist at Tom’s Rhinoplasty (a plastic surgery hospital) instead of as an insurance saleswoman. Stan also shares the same birthday as Trey.<br><br>
        Trey Parker was a shy kid who had dreams to pursue a career in film and music. He’d had this interest for writing sketches and creating comedy from a young age. When he was just in sixth grade, he wrote one of his first sketches ever- “The Dentist.” He performed it in his school’s talent show. “I played the dentist, and I had my friend play a patient. It was sort of: ‘What could go wrong at the dentist?’ I just remember I had lots of fake blood and everything. Finally, his head explodes. My parents got a call from the school; they were really upset. The kindergarteners were all crying and freaking out,” Trey Parker had stated in an interview.<br><br>
        He started consistently making short films and sketches with his friends at 14. They would continue making films until graduation. At 17, he began having an interest in music too. He’d write and record a full comedy album called <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvK7GQYyVIUr8nBZgek3WWuAzA5DUt8ip&si=fk0vSNGhD8eejLPi" class="link">Immature: A Collection of Love Ballads for the 80’s Man</a>, with his friend David Goodman. Trey Parker developed a love for musical theater and joined the Evergreen Players (a community theater outside of Denver.) He attended highschool at Evergreen High and worked a part-time job at Pizza Hut. He quickly became a popular kid, often getting lead roles in plays and getting picked as prom king. He was described as “a film geek and a music buff”.</p>

        <p class="gah">He graduated from high school in 1988, then spent a semester at Berklee College of Music before transferring to the University of Colorado at Boulder. He took a film class that required the students to collaborate with others, and it was here where he met Matt Stone. They both shared an interest in provocative, anti-authoritarian humor and Monty Python, and soon enough, became friends.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: SouthPark;">Matt Stone</h3>
        <div class="container2">
        <img src="Mattphoto.jpg" class="image2">
        <p>Matt was born on May 26, 1971 in Houston, Texas. His father was named Gerald Whitney Stone and he worked as an economic professor, and his mom was Sheila Lois, who was unemployed. His dad was of Irish-American heritage while his mother was of Jewish heritage. Similar to how Stan Marsh mirrors Trey, Kyle Broflovski mirrors Matt. Kyle’s parents were named after Stone’s parents. Matt Stone also had a younger sister named Rachel, and together they were raised in Littleton, Colorado, where they went to Heritage High School. He was also interested in music, similar to how Trey was, but couldn’t pursue it due to his dad.<br><br>
            There isn’t much else information on Matt. Unlike Trey, he doesn’t talk much in detail about his childhood, and neither do his parents. This doesn’t mean it was necessarily bad, he just doesn’t give out that much information.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: SouthPark;">College and After</h3>
        <p class="park">Their first film they made was titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=DypqvyvHeuJC4n30&v=XIk7eTt0gek&feature=youtu.be" class="link">Giant Beavers of Southern Sri Lanka (1989)</a>, which featured a giant beaver destroying the city. It was meant to parody Japanese monster movies like Godzilla. Fellow student Jason McHugh states that the ideas nearly got him “laughed out of class.” Parker and Stone would continue to write and act in various short films, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaYVbIp9P0" class="link">First Date</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FczN5PI0zQ" class="link">Man on Mars</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afw99J1_5Dw" class="link">Job Application</a>. They would shoot a film almost every week, but most would go on to be lost. Trey Parker first used the construction paper animation style on a film titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCbc4GjDyuI" class="link">American History (1992)</a> for his college animation class. It earned him his first reward: a Student Academy Award. Parker remembers sitting in the auditorium in front of students from different animation schools who had produced much more artistically impressive works and were upset that he had won.</p>
        <p class="park">He’d proceed to use this style of animation for other films, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkmxks20MPk" class="link">The Spirit of Christmas (1992)</a>. This little film follows the story of four boys building a snowman. It’s clear where the South Park style comes from, but it’s also clear that their designs were incredibly different here. Another thing to note is that the character that resembles Cartman is referred to as “Kenny,” something that would change later on. The boys build a snowman that comes to life and immediately kills the character resembling Cartman. The others panic, arguing for a bit before going to get help from Santa. Unfortunately, it turns out that Frosty, the evil snowman, was Santa the whole time. The character resembling Kenny dies, so the remaining two go to get help from Jesus. Jesus successfully takes down Frosty, and the boys celebrate. The lesson: the true spirit of Christmas is about presents.</p>
        <p class="park">They created the idea for this little skit while shooting films, and because they found it so incredibly boring, they’d sit and do little voices for each other. They found it funny and decided to make a Christmas film with kid voices since it was nearing that time of the year. Trey had already earned his reward for American History at this point, thus why he chose to use the construction paper style again. The reaction to their film was huge. At this time, it wasn’t common to see little kids on screen screaming the f word. They didn’t pay much mind to what was considered bizarre humor at the time, because their target audience was college students like them.</p>
        <p class="park">After the two had finished college, they moved to L.A. in 1993. Here, Trey Parker filmed his first ever success- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlMIFRXLW8c" class="link">Cannibal! The Musical (1993)</a>. Matt helped and acted as one of the characters in this movie. It was actually while at a screening of this movie where they met Brian Graden, and they started to collaborate on various projects. Brian had a huge interest in their creations, even telling them to “Show me everything you’ve done.” They decided to show him The Spirit of Christmas (1992); he absolutely loved it. Matt and Trey gave him permission to send it to people as a Christmas card, and Brian went on to send it to a production house and copy it into hundreds of VHS tapes. His friends loved it too, and the next year, he asked them to make another.</p>
        <p class="park"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olMsAy8HTUo" class="link">The Spirit of Christmas (1995)</a> was what came out of it. In this film, you can see that the boys look and act like how they do in the show. It starts off with the boys singing “We Wish You a Merry Christmas,” and then Jesus flies down from above. He states he’s come seeking “retribution,” and Stan immediately assumes he’s here to kill Kyle because he’s Jewish. He informs them that this isn’t the case and they take him to the mall. He picks a fight with Santa and they accidentally destroy the mall and kill Kenny in the process. They pressure the boys into picking a side, but they don’t know who to choose. Brian Boitono skates in and gives them good advice; that this is the season to try and get along and be good to each other no matter what you believe in. Stan and Kyle say some words that cause Jesus and Santa to apologize to each other, then they proceed to become friends.</p>

        <p class="park">They decided not to put their names on this animation because they really didn’t think it’d get that popular. They were quickly proven wrong when it went viral. It was being copied from VHS to VHS and handed to other friends. There was a rumor that George Clooney had copied it 300 times. The months went by and they were actually unaware of how popular it was until going to a party and some guys wanted to show everybody. Matt and Trey were like “Dude, we made that,” but the guys said they knew the creators and they were meeting with MTV. This problem arose because they didn’t put their names on it. Later, they went to New York, and a similar situation happened. Matt and Trey just continued to claim they were the creators when talking to people or picking up chicks, and suddenly multiple networks wanted to meet with them.</p>
        <p class="park">Before this point, they’d already been developing those characters from The Spirit of Christmas (1995) and pitched the idea of the South Park series. However, executives were awfully skeptical. They were broke but kept trying to pitch it, and yet executives claimed that it was too dirty and wouldn’t be funny. They soon came up with Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey, but executives told them that it wouldn’t work because people don’t want to watch a show about kids, and instead wanted one about family. MTV, Fox, and others turned them down. They still chose not to give up because if people kept copying the short that much, they knew there was a chance. Comedy Central, which was small at the time, saw the short and thought it was the funniest thing ever. They didn’t have much original content, and they really wanted to be in business with Matt and Trey.</p>
        <p class="park">After they met up with Comedy Central, they decided to produce the pilot for South Park. There were quite a few times where Herzog, the Comedy Central President at that time, wanted to pipe up and limit the jokes they were trying to do. However, he decided not to, and instead let their brilliance work. However, they were disappointed in the pilot and focus groups gave them low opinions. They’d accepted that, and believed that the show would go nowhere. They’d get three episodes in and get taken off the air. But then they redid some things, and it became the classic it is today.</p>
        <p class="park">South Park debuted to almost a million people in 1997, and it took off from there.</p>
